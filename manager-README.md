# Manager README

There’s been a bit of a rise in this idea of a Manager README - a document
wherein a manager essentially explains how they operate as a manager and to give
context about themselves. So here is an exercise in a Manager README.

**Note:** This is no longer a living document. Please see
[https://rfpludwick.github.io](https://rfpludwick.github.io) for the latest
version.

## Preface

My full name is Robert Frederick Philip Ludwick. From a young age, I have always
put my middle initial(s) in name fields, which is why you’ll see my email
signature (and other things) show Robert F.P. Ludwick. The original intent here
was to differentiate me from my grandfather; I’m just used to it now. And I do
have two middle names - I added the second one shortly before my wife and I got
married. There’s a story there, and please feel free to ask me about it
sometime.

I am married; I have a wonderful daughter, two cats, and a dog. I’ve been in
technology for over 15 years and come primarily from the LAMP stack. I became a
manager in early 2015.

This document largely covers my job as Software Development Manager for the
HostBaby Development Team at CD Baby in Portland, Oregon, USA.

## Career Tent-Poles

Most people have a set of career tent-poles - values, morals, and a work style
which are critically important to them as a person. At this point in my career,
I have two:

1. Work-life balance. I strive to ensure this balance for me and for my
employees. There may be occasions when overtime is warranted, but I endeavor to
retain work-life balance at all times. Death marches do nobody any good.
2. Diversity and inclusivity. The greater number of life experiences and
viewpoints brought to a team, the better. Groupthink does not help people grow
and learn. Being inclusive helps the more diverse among us to feel comfortable
in expressing their opinions and feelings.

## My Job

My job covers quite a lot of ground, but here are the highlights:

* Provide resources and context for your work
* Help you to grow in your career and realize your goals
* Help ensure that we deliver quality products and features to our stakeholders
and artists in a timely fashion
* Hold the team accountable for their work

## My Work Style

I am an early bird. With one brief exception, I have started my workdays by 8am
for the past 11 years. I do not expect you to match my schedule, but you may
occasionally get a morning salvo of communication from me if you start later in
the day. I try to get a lot done in the mornings.

I have email and Slack on my phone, and I will occasionally check them in
off-hours. If it is critical to contact me during off-hours, however, please
text me or call me. I will do the same if I must contact you during off-hours.
I cannot guarantee 24/7 availability as I share childcare duties at home.

## Communication

I’ll hold regular 1-on-1s with you - the schedule and length of time may vary,
but at minimum I prefer 30 minutes every two weeks. I will also have a shared
document into which both of us can list agenda items. I intend to not have our
1-on-1s focus on day-to-day operational tasks - ideally we’ll talk about
emerging trends, career trajectory, and such. That aside, I am willing to talk
about whatever you may need to talk about during our 1-on-1s. They’re for you
much more than they are for me.

I can get verbose in my written communication - sometimes too verbose. I believe
that offering plenty of detail and context is helpful in many scenarios, but
there are occasions where I need to be more concise. If you feel I’m getting too
wordy or long-winded, then please let me know. I communicate better in the
written form, and tend to prefer it in order to reduce miscommunications and
ambiguity, and to create a more “permanent record.” It allows me to better
collect my thoughts for dissemination and to refine my messaging. As a result, I
will expect you to read emails and to respond if requested to do so.

I aim to offer feedback as close to real-time as possible. If I have a concern,
some praise, or anything else contextual, then I will make an effort to bring
you the feedback as quickly as possible. I am always on the lookout for feedback
for myself as well, so please feel comfortable in giving me feedback. I will
actively solicit it and hope you feel safe enough to give me said feedback.

If we’re in a group setting discussing some problem, some idea, some whatever,
then I will largely keep my opinions to myself for a few minutes if at all
possible. Even if it’s a subject which I have brought to the group, I tend
towards letting others speak first. As a manager and leader, I know that my
words can carry more weight than I intend. This is why I let others speak first
and let discussions get rolling first unless it is necessary that I jump in with
my opinion quickly. I don’t want to steer the conversation in a particular
direction, or to possibly discourage others from voicing their opinions if those
opinions happen to differ from mine.

## Cadences & Meetings

I am a creature of habit and repetition. I will settle into my patterns and
cadences and will be quite happy there. My morning routine includes making a
daily cup of French Press coffee (if possible), for example. Over time you’ll
likely come to learn my common patterns to things like emergencies cropping up
all the way to my vocabulary patterns. If you see me acting strangely, there is
likely a reason and if you’re interested, please ask.

In terms of meetings I aim to always be on time to a meeting. To me, it is rude
to be late to a meeting because there are likely others wasting their time
waiting for latecomers. If I am chairing a meeting, then I intend to end it
early enough for others to be on time to any meetings which immediately follow.
If a meeting I’m chairing has run its course in less time than allotted, then
I’ll typically call it early to respect the time of others.

I rely on my calendar to ensure I have my day organized. I generally expect you
to also have an accurate calendar, which helps me and others to know when you
are available.

## Learning & Improvement

I’m always on the hunt to learn something or otherwise improve myself and my own
performance. These days, here are some things I’ve been putting my mind towards:

* Amazon Web Services
* Other emerging technologies (for instance, I looked at the Rust programming
language recently)
* Leadership and management, typically via blogs and others in the Rands
Leadership Slack
* Home improvement

## Other

* I enjoy levity and jokes. My sense of humor is typically described as
“Dad”-like. I tend to bring my sense of humor to work.
* My vocabulary is a tricky thing. Occasionally I’ll add new fun/obscure words
to my everyday speech, such as superfluous and anachronistic. Other times I’ll
completely forget the right technical term or acronym for something. Please seek
clarity from me if my vocabulary leaves you confused.
* People getting distracted during a meeting (via phone, typing frantically on
their laptop, etc.) bothers me.
* I learned a few jobs ago that I really love to help people. I love helping my
coworkers get their jobs done more efficiently, and I love helping my direct
reports with their needs and wants as well.
* I enjoy playing indoor soccer and video games.
* In 2016 I came down with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, which left the left side of my
face with minimal muscular control. I’ve regained some movement - but not much -
and do not expect to ever fully regain its use. So if it looks like I’m
constantly raising just one eyebrow in your direction, the other one is likely
raised “in spirit.”
